## üî∑ Area Calculation using Shoelace Formula

We want to compute the area enclosed by a series of ordered 2D points (x, y). This is done using the **Shoelace formula**, which is a classic algorithm in computational geometry for calculating the area of a polygon when the vertices are known.

The formula is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) \right|
\]

This formula "walks around" the polygon and performs a determinant-like summation.

Let's now implement it step-by-step.

# Let's first ensure we have the 'points' list loaded from a file
import pickle

with open('points.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    points = pickle.load(f)

print(f"Number of points loaded: {len(points)}")
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the coordinates

We extract the x and y coordinates from the list of points. Then, we **append the first point at the end** of the list to close the polygon loop.
x_coords = [p[0] for p in points] + [points[0][0]]  # Close the polygon by repeating the first point
y_coords = [p[1] for p in points] + [points[0][1]]

print("X coords:", x_coords)
print("Y coords:", y_coords)
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Apply the Shoelace formula

We compute the two cross-products:
- \( x_i \cdot y_{i+1} \)
- \( y_i \cdot x_{i+1} \)

and take the absolute difference of their sums, divided by 2.
import numpy as np

x = np.array(x_coords)
y = np.array(y_coords)

# Apply the Shoelace formula
area = 0.5 * np.abs(np.dot(x[:-1], y[1:]) - np.dot(y[:-1], x[1:]))

print(f"üîπ Total area enclosed: {area:.4f}")

### ‚úÖ Final Notes

- This method assumes the points form a **simple, non-intersecting polygon**.
- The order of the points matters: they must go around the shape either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
- The formula works by computing the signed area, and `np.abs()` ensures we return the positive area value.

You now have an accurate estimation of the area enclosed by your manually selected points!
